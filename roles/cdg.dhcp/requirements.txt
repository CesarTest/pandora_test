# Note: this requirements.txt file is used to specify what dependencies are
# needed to make the package run rather than for deployment of a tested set of
# packages.  Thus, this should be the loosest set possible (only required
# packages, not optional ones, and with the widest range of versions that could
# be suitable)
jinja2 >= 3.1.0  # Jinja2 native macro support fixed in 3.1.0
PyYAML >= 5.1  # PyYAML 5.1 is required for Python 3.8+ support
netaddr >= 1.0 # ipaddr filter
